Some external and habitual effects of pollution are environmental destruction, suffocation due to being tangled in plastics, and unsafe water conditions. Internal effects for animals would be the distruction of the digestive system from either an animal eating the plastic or eating an plant or smaller animal that has been exposed to acid rain or other toxins.   </p>
